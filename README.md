# Better-way-to-segment-customers
Purposes: use a data-centric approach to segmenting doctors to improve marketing, customer service, and product planning.

## Can you find a better way to segment your customers?
## ðŸ“– Background
You work for a medical device manufacturer in Switzerland. Your company manufactures orthopedic devices and sells them worldwide. The company sells directly to individual doctors who use them on rehabilitation and physical therapy patients.

Historically, the sales and customer support departments have grouped doctors by geography. However, the region is not a good predictor of the number of purchases a doctor will make or their support needs.

Your team wants to use a data-centric approach to segmenting doctors to improve marketing, customer service, and product planning.

The company stores the information you need in the following four tables. Some of the fields are anonymized to comply with privacy regulations.
